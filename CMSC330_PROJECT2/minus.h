// This file contains the class definition of the Minus class, which is a subclass of SubExpression,
// which in turn is a subclass of the Expression. Because both of its functions are one line functions, 
// they are implemented as inline functions. Its constructor initializes the left and right subexpressions
// it inherits from SubExpression by calling the constructor of the SubExpression class. Because
// it is an indirect subclass of Expression it must implement the evaluate function, which it does
// by returning the difference of the values of the two subexpressions.
